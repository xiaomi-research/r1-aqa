# R1-AQA --- Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering

## Introduction

R1-AQA is a audio question answering (AQA) model based on `Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct`, optimized through reinforcement learning (RL) using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm.
This implementation has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU benchmark with only 38k post-training samples.

Our main findings are as follows:

- The GRPO algorithm can be directly and effectively applied to the audio modality, even to `Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct` with only 8.2B parameters.
- With only 38k post-training samples, reinforcement learning outperforms supervised fine-tuning, indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets.
- The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently leverage *deep thinking* or step-by-step reasoning remains an open question for further research.
- Large audio language models (LALMs) still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further explorations.

Additional Notes:  

- The AVQA training set originally consists of approximately 40k samples. However, we use only about 38k samples because some data sources have become invalid. Other datasets using YouTube sources face a similar issue, such as AudioSet. We believe that the missing 2k samples do not have a significant impact on the training results.
- The statement about the 8.2B parameters is based on the *Qwen2-Audio Technical Report*.

## Training

### Data Preparation

We use the [AVQA](https://mn.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/avqa/) `training` subset (train_qa.json), and convert the data to the R1-AQA format, where each line in the text file represents a JSON object with specific keys

```json
{
    # The data presented below originate from the original AVQA dataset.
    "id": 183,
    "video_name": "-HG3Omg_89c_000030",
    "video_id": 341,
    "question_text": "What happened in the video?",
    "multi_choice": [  
        "motorboat",  
        "Yacht consignment",  
        "Sailboat set sail",  
        "Consignment car"  
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "question_relation": "View",
    "question_type": "Happening", 
    # We add the following data.
    "dataset_name": "AVQA",
    "audio_path": "Path to wav dir/-HG3Omg_89c_30.wav"
}
```

### GRPO

```bash
sh run_grpo.sh
```

#### Wandb

#### NOTE

- Replace the `DATA_FILE` variable in the `run_grpo.sh` with your dataset path.
- If you already have the `Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct` model, please modify the `MODEL_NP` variable in `run_grpo.sh` to your local model path.
- We recommend using a GPU with 80 GB of memory.

## Testing

### MMAU Test-mini

Evaluate the MMAU `Test-mini` dataset, please follow these steps:

- Download Data
  - To test the MMAU Test-mini dataset requires the following files from the [MMAU](https://github.com/Sakshi113/MMAU/tree/main) repository: [mmau-test-mini.json](https://github.com/Sakshi113/MMAU/blob/main/mmau-test-mini.json), [evaluation.py](https://github.com/Sakshi113/MMAU/blob/main/evaluation.py), and [test-mini-audios.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fERNIyTa0HWry6iIG1X-1ACPlUlhlRWA/view?usp=sharing). The method for obtaining data is as follows:

```bash
mkdir -p data && cd data

git clone https://github.com/Sakshi113/MMAU.git

cd data/MMAU

# ***Check if output_key = 'model_output' in evaluation.py, change it to output_key = 'model_prediction'.***

#TODO you should download test-mini-audios.tar.gz to here
***download test-mini-audios.tar.gz to here***

# Uncompress wav files
tar -xzvf test-mini-audios.tar.gz

cd ../../
```

- Evaluation

```bash
# Testing MMAU test-mini with in every 100 steps. 
# You can uncomment the line 12 of test_mmau.sh to eval the entire MMAU, if you have downloaded test-audios.tar.gz.
# You can modify the script to test other steps or change other parameters.
sh test_mmau.sh
```

## Hacking It

We encourage hacking it on your own. If you want to see the "thinking" or improve our work, here are some hints:

> 1. Uncomment the line 25 of `src\dataset\dataset.py`;
> 2. Uncomment the line 55 of `src\utils\rewards.py`;
> 3. Uncomment the line 46 of `src\test.py`;
> 4. Train and test your model;
> 5. ***Design your CoT strategy based on `<think> </think>`. Let's explore effective ways to combine RL and CoT!***
